# Chapter 13: Bonus: Kitty Genes

If you recall from lesson 1, we're currently only using the first 12 digits of our 16 digit DNA to determine the zombie's appearance. So let's use the last 2 unused digits to handle "special" characteristics.

We'll say that cat-zombies have 99 as their last two digits of DNA (since cats have 9 lives). So in our code, we'll say if a zombie comes from a cat, then set the last two digits of DNA to 99.

If statements
If statements in Solidity look just like javascript:

```
function eatBLT(string memory sandwich) public {
  // Remember with strings, we have to compare their keccak256 hashes
  // to check equality
  if (keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sandwich)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked("BLT"))) {
    eat();
  }
}
```
